give in form of new array comma seperated give all 2 new values [heading1, heading2] there should be 2 values  in the array each seperated by a comma. the values should be new values for my clothing brand make 2 headings based on cloths selling brand in form of new array comma seperated give all 2 new values [heading1, heading2] do not use '=>' just use comma and then the value, do not forget the square brackets first enter heading1 add a comma then heading2 this way complete all 2 headings do not use any other format if you understand say yes and start the answer, do not give old values I only need the new values, if you can give the new values in the correct format say yes and start the answer the correct format is an array seperated by commas an array is square brackets with comma seperated values inside. if you understand the format which is [heading1,heading2] in code format give new values. Give only one new array of items dont give 
[heading1,heading2] then another array [heading1,heading2] only give one new array. say yes if you understand and then give the singular one array
