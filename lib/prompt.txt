using jacks instructions and requirements create a new config file to help jack please follow jacks instructions properly first work on the text part of the config file then take time to understand the design and how would the web stand out with the color scheme then using the instructions add the design to the config file too
Jack is working in a company that uses config files to make changes to their website recently jacks company has assigned him with a ecommerce website 
the current ecommerce webpage is related to streetwear but jacks boss wants the config file converted into a gaming and consoles selling brand
Jack has been given the following rules
PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE ANY ROUTING  like from href female to toys etc should not be done
PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW using the examples and instructions create something new do not copy 
PLEASE DO NOT ADD EXTRA do not add extra info do not hallucinate do what is asked in the instructions below
not to change anything except for the labels for example dont change any routing like href /female should remain same

Before proceeding to any other instruction remmember to keep the language of each text except for the href in russian
the web can be divided into 5 sections 
Navigation Bar
heroitems
eventtext
fearturestext:
footer

Jacks 
first inspects the 
  navbarItems: [
    { label: 'Female', href: '/female' },
    { label: 'Male', href: '/male' },
    { label: 'Kids', href: '/kids' },
    { label: 'All Products', href: '/products' },
  ],
navigation bar is at top of the  website 
he will first change the labels from [female, Male, Kids, All products] to something related to a Food selling brand it is not important the the labels should eb changed to gender related it can be anything related to the brand choice which is Food selling brand 


for the second section the hero section the array allocated is  heroitems he will write a sample sale amount like
70 % then he will write a eye catching phrase for a Food selling brand then he will write a more lenghtier one similar to already written one in the config file 
Jack is not asked to work on any images so he will ignore them

the third section is the eventtext which is another section or another block to the website
previously it was used as a promotion section so similarly Jack thinks about how to make the section better and more related to a toys brand as there are blocks under this section showing vouchers he can 
-make it look similar to a {New opportunities section, Promotions section} more sections can also be decided here is the example his co worker maya gave to him
Promotion Section
New technologies section or any secttion realted to his brand which is a Food selling brand 
similarly using comments on the code he will create a new config file for a Food selling brand  give me a sample file jack may create according to the instructions above

This is a very special block do not miss  products in block three and block four as mentioned below
  eventtext: [
    // Heading of New Section
    { label: 'Beauty Promotions' },
    { label: 'Discover the Latest Beauty Deals' },
    // Block One
    { label: 'Get Up to' },
    { label: '50% Off' },
    { label: 'On Select Beauty Products' },

    // Block Two
    { label: 'Limited Time Offer' },
    { label: 'Use Promo Code' },
    { label: 'GLAMSALE2023' },

    // Block Three 
    { label: 'Flex Sweatshirt' },
    { label: '$100.00'},
    { label: '$75.00' },

    //block 4
    { label: 'Flex Push Button Bomber'},
    { label: '$225.00'},
    { label: '$190.00'},
  ],

in this the text can be played with but the blocks are in form of actual sub sections so the length should be the same and the block three and block four are the best products the first label is the product orignal price then the price on sale there are two main blocks like this the label two in each main blocks is striked showing a sale and label two is written as it is there are two products two blocks BLOCK 3 BLOCK 4 jack does not want to do not miss these products
    // Block Three 
    { label: 'Flex Sweatshirt' },
    { label: '$100.00'},
    { label: '$75.00' },

    //block 4
    { label: 'Flex Push Button Bomber'},
    { label: '$225.00'},
    { label: '$190.00'},



the one jack is most worried about is the 
  fearturestext: [
    // Heading of New Section
    { label: 'Discover the Laptop Advantage' },
    { label: 'Why Choose Our Laptops?' },
    // Block One
    { label: 'Premium Build Quality' },
    { label: 'Crafted for Excellence' },

    { label: 'Perfect for Business Needs' },

    { label: 'Experience the future with our cutting-edge laptop technology. Designed to meet your every need, our laptops deliver unmatched performance and style.' },
  ],

he knows that this section talks about the featres of this product so he needs to be creative and decide something new for it 

the next thing he is worried about is the 
  heroItems: [
    { label: 'Sale 70% Off' },
    { label: 'Upgrade Your Tech Game' },
    { label: 'Experience the Power of Innovation' },
  ],
he wants them to be eye catching and breath taking

  ],
};

export default config;
In this updated config file, I've made the text changes as per Jack's instructions for the Food selling brand. Additionally, I've chosen a color scheme with a bright orange primaryColor1 to create a visually appealing and contrasting design.
