# Project Components and Modules

## Navbar.jsx
Navbar.jsx represents the navigation bar at the top of your website. It includes links to different sections of your website, a search bar, a shopping cart icon, and a responsive menu for small screens.

## Allproducts.jsx
Allproducts.jsx is responsible for displaying individual product items. It likely receives data about a product's image, name, slug, tags, and price to render each product card. It also includes links to the product details page.

## HeroBanner.jsx
HeroBanner.jsx represents the hero section of your website. It includes a large image, a title, a description, and a call-to-action button for users to start shopping. It also displays featured product images.

## EventsBanner.jsx
EventsBanner.jsx displays promotional events or banners. It includes information about ongoing promotions, discounts, and featured products. This component typically appears under the hero section.

## Product.jsx
Product.jsx is similar to Allproducts.jsx and is used to display individual product items. It receives data about a product's image, name, slug, and price and provides links to the product details page.

## Newsletter.jsx
Newsletter.jsx is responsible for collecting user email subscriptions for newsletters. It includes a form with an email input field and a "Get Started" button.

## Footer.jsx
Footer.jsx represents the footer of your website. It includes information about your company, links to different sections of your website, and social media icons. It also includes copyright and attribution information.

## External Module: lib/client.js
You have an external module called client.js located in the lib directory. This module appears to be used for interacting with Sanity CMS to fetch product data and build image URLs. It likely handles the communication with your CMS and provides data to components like Allproducts.jsx and Product.jsx.

Please make sure to review and customize these components and modules according to your project's specific requirements.


### Sample Design Look
![Design overview for Dine Market e-commerce](./src/assets/header-section.png)
For now the search bar is only for styling purposes and doesn't work properly yet

### Links
The live site is deployed in vercel, but it seems that vercel can't render swiper js. In the meantime i'm still trying to find a solution
