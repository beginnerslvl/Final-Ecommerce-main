# Getting Images

We need a total of 6 images for the following:

1. Hero section image.
2. One image for sale.
3. Two images of the best-selling products.
4. One image for section four opening.

## Coding Images Overview

We will use stable diffusion with enhancements to act as mid-journey. Here's the process:

1. **Getting Images**: Get images from Google related to our brand using deep learning or use sample brand images to create new ones.

2. **Deep Learning To Enhance Images**:

   - [Tutorial Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67hqsP7fhvQ)
   
   Use the tutorials above to enhance images. Use sample images from the internet by searching for "toys selling brand" to enhance the images.

3. **Stable Diffusion**:

4. **Resizing Image to Perfection**:
   Use the Segment Anything model.

# Step Five

Based on the color scheme, add effects to the images. For example, if you have a darker background, apply an appropriate image filter.
